/* QC_call_client_include.php
 * Part of QC system by Poundteam.
 * Location: /vicidial/qc
 * Included in: qc_modify_lead.php
 * Purpose: Determine availability of "Call Lead" button and call the lead when button is pressed.
 * Also: display REASON if lead cannot be called by pressing button (to allow agent to resolve the reason without guessing)
 */
/* 1. Is logged in admin user also logged in as an agent?
 *    If not: display admin user name followed by "not logged in as agent"
 * 2. Is logged in agent available to manual dial this prospect?
 *    Requires pause or manual mode and campaign with this prospect available.
 * 3. If possible, log the agent in with NO permission to change data on the agent screen. Require changes ONLY on QC screen (except hangup button).
