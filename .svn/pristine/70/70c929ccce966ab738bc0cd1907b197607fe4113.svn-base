########## UPGRADING FROM 2.0.5 TO 2.2.0 ##########

1. install new files:
	perl ./install.pl
	NOTES: If you have customized any scripts in the bin or agi folders, 
	then make sure you back them up before running the install.pl script. 
	This script will replace existing files in the astguiclient installation.

2. upgrade the MySQL asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.2.0.sql
	quit





########## UPGRADING FROM 2.0.4 TO 2.0.5 ##########

1. Note the license change from GPLv2 to AGPLv2. This change was made to close
	the ASP loophole for code distribution that was present in the GPLv2 
	license. Please read the docs/LICENSE.txt file for more information

2. install new files:
	perl ./install.pl
	NOTES: If you have customized any scripts in the bin or agi folders, 
	then make sure you back them up before running the install.pl script. 
	This script will replace existing files in the astguiclient installation.

3. upgrade the MySQL asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.5.sql
	quit

4. Several of the MySQL tables have been changed to a HEAP type to reside in
	memory to improve performance.

5. Added the ability for inbound and blended agents to choose their selected
	in-groups without logging out. The new GROUPS link at the top of the 
	agent screen(vicidial.php) can be used when an agent is Paused to
	change their selected groups and whether they are set to do Blended
	calling or not. There is also a new log with the details of what
	groups an agent has selected each time in the user stats page.

6. Queue Priority has been added allowing for the prioritization of one in-group
	over another in-group or outbound campaign(when in blended mode)

7. Drop call action has been added to both inbound and outbound calling. You
	can now send a call that would drop into an inbound group. The call will
	still be recorded as a DROP in it's original in-group or campaign, but 
	the lead information will move on to the drop in-group.

8. Audio recording mixing/compression/ftping scripts have been completely
	rewritten and separated into different scripts for better fault
	tolerance. Also, you have the option of compression in to the following
	formats: WAV, GSM, MP3 and OGG
	- AST_CRON_audio_1_move_mix.pl
	- AST_CRON_audio_1_move_VDonly.pl
	- AST_CRON_audio_2_compress.pl
	- AST_CRON_audio_3_ftp.pl

9. Created a new script to backup a VICIDIAL setup, including the Asterisk conf
	files, prompt recordings, bin, agi and web files:
	ADMIN_backup.pl

10. Added ability to override recording options of a campaign for individual
	inbound-groups

11. The 8 outbound agi-VDADtransfer scripts are in process of being consolidated
	into a single AGI script: agi-VDAD_ALL_outbound.agi
	All older outbound scripts are depricated and do not function any more

12. The start of a new QC (Quality Control) feature [non functional right now]

13. Install the Switch perl module from CPAN
	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	- install Switch

14. Recording to RAM now uses tmpfs it is usually included in all kernels if you want 
	to check in in menuconfig you will find it under
	File Systems --> Pseudo filesystems --> [*] Virtual memory file system support.
	It does not hurt to enable 
	[*] Tmpfs POSIX Access Control Lists  
	as well.
	The following line should be added to /etc/fstab:
	tmpfs                /var/spool/asterisk/monitor  tmpfs  rw                    0 0
	Mounting the ramdisk in rc.local should be remove:
	# mke2fs -m 0 /dev/ram0
	# mount /dev/ram0 /var/spool/asterisk/monitor
	This allows for a more efficient use of memory and recording to RAM with less RAM 
	available.

15. The following should be added to the [featuremap] section of /etc/asterisk/features.conf
	to prevent agents and called parties from being able to "transfer" a call to any 
	number possible in your Asterisk dialplan.
	[featuremap]
	blindxfer => D

16. Added ip_relay to allow for loopback IAX trunks that make true blind 
	monitoring possible for all agents no matter their phone type 0860XXXX.

17. Added the ability to load balance the logins to vicidial.php for phones 
	that are registered to multiple servers on a multi-server system. 
	Simply put multiple phone_login values in the phone login field at 
	login separated by a comma and the vicidial.php script will pick the 
	server that has the fewest agents logged into it at the moment of login.

18. Added ability for vicidial.php to populate the phones.computer_ip field upon
	agent login. Options set in the vicidial.php file to allow for overwrite
	every login or only if field is empty.

19. Several code changes for better UTF8 compatibility with the database as well
	as special character leads in the agent screen, lead loading

20. Added after hours redirect of calls to an in-group to another in-group

21. Added collection of hangup reasons for inbound and outbound calls in the
	vicidial_log and vicidial_closer_log tables

22. Added a new timeclock feature w/ audit and log, including the addition
	of shifts to VICIDIAL user groups and the ability to auto-generate 
	user IDs as you are adding users to the system. timeclock.php user login
	page created and linked to from admin/agent/welcome screens

23. Added a new inbound/closer(queues) report for showing service levels

24. Added Calls in Queue counter to agent vicidial.php screen

25. Added ability to use calltime scheme for calls not yet in an in-group(queue)
	as well as display in real-time stats. See Inbound_VDAC_IVR.txt doc for
	more information

26. Auto-dial survey broadcast campaigns can now be fully configured within the 
	admin.php interface and they have new options shown in the Survey sub-
	section

27. Changed add-to-DNC list to allow for multiple phone numbers per submission

28. Date/time and phone formats that appear in the VICIDIAL agent screen are now
	customizable as defined in the Admin -> System Settings screen.

29. Added manual dial and inbound queue_log logging capability for better
	QueueMetrics compatibility

30. Added some basic agent interface API functions and an agc/api.php script

31. A field has been added to vicidial_list(last_local_call_time) to sort by
	the last time a lead was called as well as for lead recycling changes.

32. IMPORTANT FOR RECORDINGS!!!
   The recording extensions have been changed within VICIDIAL so you need to
   add the following lines to your extensions.conf
     ; quiet monitor-only entry and leaving conferences for VICIDIAL (recording)
     exten => _58600XXX,1,Meetme,${EXTEN:1}|Fmq

33. Added option (for Internet Explorer users only) to copy a field to the
   clipboard of the agent computer upon a call being sent to the agent.

34. Added new alternate number dialing method which allows for over 65,000 alt
   phone numbers per lead. Currently these extra numbers are only available for 
   auto dialing, not manual dial. These extra alternate number leads must be 
   imported either with the CLI lead loader(VICIDIAL_IN_new_leads_file.pl) or
   the non-agent API script.

35. Added campaign-specific DNC filtering lists to the system

36. Added optional dialplan entries to sample extensions.conf to play a not-in-
    service message for invalid phone numbers that cannot be dialing in North
    America

37. Rewrote Leave-3way function for conference calling to work more reliably on
    high load systems.
	Need to add more vicidial_conferences entries and meetme.conf entries
	for this, see the meetme.conf.sample file and the 
	first_server_install.sql file for more information

38. Added several new features to inbound call handling including:
	- announce place in line
	- announce estimated hold time
	- welcome message options
	- options for call routing when estimated hold time is too high
	- press 1 to leave a voicemail for customers if wait time too high

39. Added DID call routing to allow for basic routing of calls to phones, 
   extensions, voicemail and VICIDIAL inbound groups without editing the 
   extensions.conf dialplan. 
   *requires initial adding one line to dialplan of inbound context:
      exten => _X.,1,AGI(agi-DID_route.agi)
   *as well as a few more lines in your VICIDIAL default context:
      ; DID forwarded calls
      exten => _99909*.,1,Answer
      exten => _99909*.,2,AGI(agi-VDAD_ALL_inbound.agi)
      exten => _99909*.,3,Hangup

40. Added ability to set callerID number on outgoing conference calls to
   CAMPAIGN, CUSTOMER or AGENT_PHONE callerID settings.

41. New Slovak translation for the agent screen, as well as new German agent
   screen translation and new German buttons for the agent screen

42. New Welcome demo and languages screens with links to all translations of 
   agent and admin screens

43. Added INBOUND_MAN dial method to allow for inbound call handling by agents
   that are also placing manual dial list calls through their campaign lists

44. Added option to see the inbound group call stats in the Real-time screen

45. Added ability for agents to dial in to an AGI script(agi-AGENT_dial_in.agi)
   to log their phone into the session instead of having VICIDIAL call them.
   The user ID and password for the agent must be digits only for this to work!
   This requires the following to be added to the dialplan on the dial-in DID
   or extension that you want to use:
	exten => 2345,1,Answer		; Answer the line
	exten => 2345,2,AGI(agi-AGENT_dial_in.agi)
	exten => 2345,3,Hangup

46. Added pause codes display to the Real-time report as well as pause code
   statistics to the agent performance detail report. Also added an option to
   force agents to enter a pause code(this is a campaign option)

47. Added full MySQL error logging to vicidial agent web interface. Logs are 
   written to the webserver.

48. Added new inbound-only reporting to Real-time report as well as many new
   features to existing inbound report. Created IVR stats report to show stats
   on Asterisk IVRs

49. Updated Vtiger integration to version 5.0.4 and allow searching by 
   leads/accounts/vendors. Also added user synchronization with vicidial_users. 
   Also added click-to-dial from Vtiger sending call to vicidial agent screen.
   Also added batch synchronization of Accounts between Vtiger and VICIDIAL.

50. Added notification of time synchronization problems in the vicidial.php page

51. Added AGENTDIRECT queueing to be able to send calls to only one agent 
   without having to create a new in-group for each agent. You can configure
   DIDs to use AGENTDIRECT, and you can have VICIDIAL agents send calls to 
   specific agents using the AGENTDIRECT transfer group with LOCAL CLOSER button
   and putting the agent to send the call to in the Number To Dial field.

52. Added agent alert option to agent screen. sends browser alert prompt when
   a call is send to the agent screen.

53. Added option for using North American NANPA prefix timezone encoding for
   more accurate time zone encoding. The data is NOT included but can be 
   purchased from the VICIDIAL Group.

54. Added System Settings option to disable auto-dialing(list dialing) from the
   system to simplify administration for inbound-only call centers

55. Added patch and configuration options to allow VICIDIAL to work with Sangoma
   ParaXip CPD(Call Progress Detection) for Answering Maching and Fax detection

56. Added list_download.php that allows you to download the entire contents of
   vicidial lists from the admin.php interface. You must set the download_lists
   permission in vicidial_users to 1 for this to work.

57. Small redesign of the agent interface to use grey backgrounds and new tabs

58. Added Asterisk version prompt to the install.pl script to allow for the
   copying of the proper conf files for the installed Asterisk version

59. Added auto-generation of SIP and IAX phones and carriers into the Asterisk 
   conf files so that you can fully configure them using only the admin.php
   web interface. See the ASTERISK_CONF-GEN.txt file for more information

60. Added group alias option for selecting callerID on manual and 3rd-party
   calls

   camaign. This is definable in the user modification page

62. Added Agent Shift enforcement options to restrict logins and vicidial 
   agent activity 

63. Added Server vital statistics(load/CPU/disk) to the reports screen and the
   server modification screen

64. Removed the admin_changes flat text log file and now put all administrative 
   actions into the vicidial_admin_log table in MySQL. These logs are displayed
   to user_level 9 users in admin.php through a link on the REPORTS screen, and 
   at the bottom of the other screens (USERS, CAMPAIGNS, LISTS, etc...)you can 
   click on the "Click here to see Admin chages to this record" link to find out
   the most recent changes to that record.

65. Added uniform admin headers to all administrative pages and reports

   another without hanging up





########## UPGRADING FROM 2.0.3 TO 2.0.4 ##########

1. install new files:
	perl ./install.pl
	NOTES: If you have customized any scripts in the bin or agi folders, 
	then make sure you back them up before running the install.pl script. 
	This script will replace existing files in the astguiclient installation.

2. upgrade the MySQL asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.4.sql
	quit
	NOTE: If you do not use the standard "cron" database login, you will
	need to add "LOCK TABLES" to the permissions to your db login

3. add the "server_reports" directory to your Web Path:
	mkdir $PATHweb/vicidial/server_reports/
	chmod 0777 $PATHweb/vicidial/server_reports/

4. A new set of changes have been made to the statuses sections in the admin.php
	pages allowing for categorizing statues and modifying them without delete.
	Also, the gathering of a tally of the statuses in these categories is 
	now available on the timeonVDADall scripts.

5. The admin.php interface has had more sections broken into sub-sections for
	easier management and rapid modifications.

6. Added option for shorter enter and leave sounds(done during Asterisk build)
	BASE/SCRATCH_INSTALL or extras/Changed_meetme_sounds for more details

7. Added optional patch to meetme in Asterisk 1.2.X that will allow for better 
	DTMF passthru. Need to use the "F" flag to enable on Meetme in 
	extensiosn.conf. Feature is backported from Asterisk 1.4.X

8. REQUIRED! Changed the FastAGI_log process to consolidate the "h" exten hangup 
	process into one executed function instead of two. Because of this, the 
	h exten needs to be changed to only the following:
	exten => h,1,DeadAGI(agi://127.0.0.1:4577/call_log--HVcauses--PRI-----NODEBUG-----${HANGUPCAUSE}-----${DIALSTATUS}-----${DIALEDTIME}-----${ANSWEREDTIME}))

10. Added agent alert, music-on-hold and several other parameters to inbound 
	groups. Make sure you have musiconhold working properly before using 
	in production.

11. REQUIRED CHANGE! in your dialplan you must now add lines for load balancing
	even if you only have one server, and you must also have lines with the
	7 prefix for silent insertion into the meetme conference:
		exten => _010*010*010*015*8600XXX,...
		exten => _010*010*010*015*8600XXX*.,...
		exten => _010*010*010*015*78600XXX,...
		exten => _010*010*010*015*78600XXX*.,...
		exten => _78600XXX*.,1,AGI(agi-VDADfixCXFER.agi)
	See LOAD_BALANCING.txt and extensions.conf.sample for more information

12. Inbound, Blended and Closer-type campaigns are no longer required to have
	campaign_id incude specific words or characters to be treated as such.
	There is now a new campaign_allow_inbound field where this is set.

13. Call distribution by agent ranking per in-group and total calls to in-group

14. Added ability to copy the settings campaigns, users and in-groups to new records

15. REQUIRED CHANGE! Old inbound and Closer AGI scripts have all been consolidated
	into a single script: agi-VDAD_ALL_inbound.agi
	Please look at the script header or the SCRATCH_INSTALL doc for more
	info on how to alter your extenions.conf to use the new script.
	The old agi-VDAD_closer... scripts have all been depricated and moved
	to the extras/old_agi/ directory.

16. AST_agent_performance_detail.php report script has been completely rewritten

17. REQUIRED CHANGE! If you use Fronter/Closer campaigns where an agent is sending
	calls to a closer, you will need to define the new "Default Transfer Group"
	field with the inbound group that you want to take the calls. Transfers
	are now allowed from a list of definable in-groups that you have to set
	in the campaign detail screen.

18. In the vicidial.php code, you can now modify the size of the elements on the
	screen using the BROWSER_HEIGHT and BROWSER_WIDTH variables.





########## UPGRADING FROM 2.0.2 TO 2.0.3 ##########

1. install new files:
	perl ./install.pl
	NOTES: If you have customized any scripts in the bin or agi folders, 
	then make sure you back them up before running the install.pl script. 
	This script will replace existing files in the astguiclient installation.

2. upgrade the MySQL asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.3.sql
	quit

3. The server_stats.php has been merged into the vicidial/admin.php page

4. Width of the admin.php screen, and the color and size of the headers are all
	now definable by variables at top of the admin.php script.

5. Dial Override checkbox added to the campaign modification screen of admin.php
	to force manual dial_level changes in ADAPT dialing modes.

6. Behaviour of HotKeys in manual dial mode has changed to automatically go on 
	to the next lead when a HotKey is pressed.

7. It is now possible for agents to dial alternate phone numbers using only
	HotKeys if ALTPH2 and/or ADDR3 are added to a campaign's hotkeys.

8. You can now use BLEND/INBND/*_C/*_B/*_I to define a campaign a a CLOSER 
	campaign capable of taking inbound calls.

9. In Auto-dialing campaigns(RATIO and ADAPT) you can now configure the dialer 
	to dial up to two alternate numbers per lead automatically, as well as 
	defining the statuses that you want to do this for. More info about
	this feature in the ALTERNATE_NUMBER_DIALING.txt doc.

10. Added ability to send multiple concurrent transfers at once to agents in 
	outbound campaigns. This will greatly benefit larger VICIDIAL 
	installations by decreasing the time it takes for a call to get	to an 
	agent once answered after a large queue backup. This is defaulted to 
	AUTO, but can be forced to a set number. This is the Concurrent 
	Transfers option in the Campaign Modification page.

11. New optimized code for AST_manager_send.pl and AST_send_action_child.pl. 
	Thanks to Lott Caskey for the code contribution

12. The field user_group has been added to several log tables to allow for 
	better tracking of stats by user groups. Several reports now offer 
	user group display options.

13. VERY IMPORTANT!!! Make sure the php.ini setting for memory_limit is set to 
	a minimum of 12M, we recommend 48M:
		memory_limit = 48M
	Some of the scripts have grown in size and need more memory to run
	properly on some systems.

14. Added ability to control access to each admin section by vicidial_users.
	This includes a view_reports settings to restrict access to all of the
	reports scripts.

15. Added Agent Pause Codes that are definable per campaign and allows the
	agent to select what they are doing when they are in pause time.

16. Added optional Asterisk-compatible queue_log logging for QueueMetrics
	compatibility. See the QUEUEMETRICS.txt doc for more information

17. RECOMMENDATION - If you are calling in the USA, you should add the 
	"--postal-code-gmt" flag to your adjust GMT script in the crontab to
	more accurately assign timezones to your leads.

18. Changed dial statuses to use dynamic number of dial statuses instead of
	static dial_status_x fields.

19. Added Mute/UnMute ability to vicidial.php agent screen. To use, you must
	have the _X18600XXX and _X28600XXX entries in your extensions.conf

20. Added basic sipsak display on compatible SIP devices for VICIDIAL activity.

21. Tested with Asterisk 1.2.16 and 1.2.17, new patch for meetme volume controls
	for those two versions, see SCRATCH_INSTALL for more info.

22. Added HOME link to the admin web page that goes to a configurable web address.






########## UPGRADING FROM 2.0.1 TO 2.0.2 ##########

1. install new files:
	perl ./install.pl
	NOTES: If you have customized any scripts in the bin or agi folders, 
	then make sure you back them up before running the install.pl script. 
	This script will replace existing files in the astguiclient installation.

	/etc/astguiclient.conf has new variables for new functionality including:
	- new ADMIN_keepalive_ALL process settings
	- FastAGI_log server settings
	and comments are added to the astguiclient.conf file

2. upgrade the MySQL asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.2.sql
	quit
	/usr/share/astguiclient/ADMIN_area_code_populate.pl
		The Daylight Savings Time scheme for the USA and Canada has been
		updated for the 2007 changes. Also, Brazil DST has been added.
		Another addition on this topic is the addition of USA zipcode
		GMT offset list that allows for more accurate timezone lookups.

3. The astguiclient web directory has been removed and the 
	astguiclient/admin.php functions have been merged into the 
	vicidial/admin.php page

4. You can now define trunks for use only by specific campaigns. See the help
	in the vicidial/admin.php server modification page under the 
	VICIDIAL SERVER TRUNKS section.

5. Agents now have the ability to control volume levels for any call in their 
	meetme room directly from the vicidial.php page. This only works on 
	Asterisk 1.2.7.1, 1.2.12.1, 1.2.13 or SVN_1.2 and the meetmeadmin_volume_control.patch
	patch must be applied as described in the SCRATCH_INSTALL. Also, a few 
	lines must be added to the extensions.conf for this to work:
	(_X48600XXX, _X38600XXX, 8300 [see docs/conf_examples/extensions.conf.sample])

6. Multiple ADMIN_keepalive scripts have been replaced with a single script
	ADMIN_keepalive_ALL.pl
	Remove all other ADMIN keepalive entries in your crontab and replace
	with this one:
	### keepalive script for astguiclient processes
	* * * * * /usr/share/astguiclient/ADMIN_keepalive_ALL.pl

	NOTE: the scripts to be kept alive are to be defined in the astguiclient.conf file

7. FastAGI replacement for call_log and VD_hangup AGI scripts:
	FastAGI_log.pl - requires cpan module Net::Server to run
	If you want to use it, read the comments at the top of the script
	Look at the docs/conf_examples/extensions.conf.sample file for examples
	of how to use this new feature in your dialplan
	- cpan
	- install Net::Server

8. Fix for unregistered SIP trunks (thanks to Chris Doyle):
	look at the bottom of the docs/conf_examples/extensions.conf.sample
	file for examples of what to put in your extensions.conf file to get
	VICIDIAL auto dialing to work with non-registered SIP trunks. remember 
	to put sip-silence.gsm in your /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/ directory.

9. Added new campaign summary screen and reformatted the timeonVDADall report:
	A summary screen with all of the call information for every active 
	campaign for the day. reformatted campaign Realtime report with new
	colors and other display options.

10. Added new script to change the server_ip entries when a machine changes IPs
	The ADMIN_update_server_ip.pl script can be used to update your server's
	IP address within all vicidial database tables and config files from
	this one script. This can even be run in the crontab if you are on
	a DHCP service and need to modify your IP address often

11. Added new script to allow for dial-out-only(no agents on the server) 
	VICIDIAL servers as well as balance dialing where a server with 
	available trunk lines can dial lines for another server that does not
	have enough lines to dial for it's dial_level. AST_VDauto_dial_FILL.pl
	script is only for multi-server systems and is started from new 
	ADMIN_keepalive_ALL.pl script with option 7 in astguiclient.conf

12. Added the ability to restrict agent logins by user group to a specific set
	of campaigns. This is definable in the USER GROUPS section of admin.php.
	You must make sure that your admin login is in a user group and that
	the selected user group has the allowable campaigns set to ALL
	CAMPAIGNS to be able to view and modify all campaigns in the system.

13. Added lead_id and user fields to the recording_log, along with cross-
	reference links in several admin web pages for these.

14. Changed Drop percentage to be out of Answered calls for FTC compliance.

15. Tested new asterisk-perl module (0.09) and found that it is NOT compatible.
	Please make sure you use asterisk-perl-0.08 ONLY.





########## UPGRADING FROM 1.1.12-3 TO 2.0.1 ##########

If you are upgrading to the 2.0 code tree from the 1.1.12-3 release there have 
been several changes made to the code base and to where some files are stored in
the release as well as on your machine.

1. upgrade the MySQL Asterisk database:
	mysql
	use asterisk
	\. /path/from/root/extras/upgrade_2.0.1.sql
	quit


2. use the new installer for astguiclient-VICIDIAL files:
	NOTE: this new script is interactive with prompts. this script will
	create the new /etc/astguiclient.conf settings file that replaces the
	old AST_SERVER_conf.pl file that has been removed. Also, this settings
	file is used by dbconnect.php scripts so no need to manually edit them

	perl install.pl


3. Make sure you have MySQL clientlibs installed:
Because all perl script now use DBI instead of Net::MySQL you need to make sure 
that you have at least the MySQL client installed on all VICIDIAL servers even 
if the MySQL server is installed on another machine. You can skip this step if 
MySQL server is already on your VICIDIAL server:
  Go to http://www.mysql.com/ and download the mysql package
   - to install this directly on the command line type:
	- cd /usr/local
	- wget http://mirror.trouble-free.net/mysql_mirror/Downloads/MySQL-4.0/mysql-4.0.27.tar.gz
	- gunzip mysql-4.0.27.tar.gz
	- tar xvf mysql-4.0.27.tar
	- cd mysql-4.0.27
	- groupadd mysql
	- useradd -g mysql mysql
	- "./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql --without-server --enable-shared=yes --with-readline"
	- make
	- make install
   - you are done


4. New MySQL perl modules:
You will need to make sure that you have installed the following perl modules:
DBI (top-level Database interface module "install DBI")
DBD::mysql (MySQL-specific interface through DBI "force install DBD::mysql")


5. new predictive dialing crontab entry:
If you will be using the new predictive dialing functions you need to make sure 
you have the keepalive for this function loaded in your crontab:
NOTE: this only needs to be on a single server if you are in a multiple 
VICIDIAL server setup.
### keepalive script for VICIDIAL predictive script
* * * * * /usr/share/astguiclient/ADMIN_keepalive_AST_VDadapt.pl


6. all old crontab entries and /home/cron files 
All of your old crontab entries need to be changed from /home/cron to
/usr/share/astguiclient if you choose the default installation path. You can
manually set the path to /home/cron if you like though since the home path is
now dynamic in all vicidial perl(.pl) scripts. If you do choose to use the new
default path, you can delete everything in the /home/cron directory if you like


7. old /etc/rc.d/rc.local entries
Be sure to change your /etc/rc.d/rc.local entries(the commands that are run at
system boot to start asterisk and other scripts like log rolling) and change the
/home/cron path to the new /usr/share/astguiclient path.


8. other notes:
- there is a new DIAL METHOD field and several other new dial-control fields 
in campaign modification page, please take a minute to read the help 
documentation for these new features.
