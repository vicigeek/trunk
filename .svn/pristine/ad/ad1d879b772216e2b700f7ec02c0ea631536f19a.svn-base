OUTBOUND DIALING OPTIMIZATIONS DOC	Started: 2016-11-15	Updated: 2016-12-01


This document is a work in progress and is meant for reference only, to go over approaches to optimizing and speeding up the outbound auto-dialing processes



Places to look at for speeding up outbound auto-dialing call routing speed:
1. Checking for Local/ channel resolution
2. Database load and query speed
3. AGI script compilation and execution time





SECTION 1.  LOCAL/ CHANNEL RESOLUTION

First, and explanation of what exatly the "Local/ channel resolution" issue is. Auto-dial calls are placed from VICIdial to Asterisk using a Local/ channel, which goes to the dialplan and places the calls out through a carrier. When the call is placed, there is no audio stream yet, only signalling, and it stays that way until after the Answer signal is received from the carrier. At that point, the Local/ channel will resolve to it's proper channel pointer(usually SIP/... if using a sip carrier) and the pseudo channels that were created go away. Where the issues come in, is how long it takes for the audio to begin being received so that the channel pointer can resolve. This is extremely variable, and depends on the end customer carrier, as well as all of the carrier equipment in-between. We have seen Local/ channels resolve anywhere from 0.01 seconds up to 2 seconds, and in a small percentage of cases, the channel never resolves because no audio stream is ever received, even after 30 seconds of waiting post-Answer-signal. Another thing to remember related to this, Asterisk isn't perfect, and sometimes those pseudo channels will register as Answered for a split second before disappearing, which is another reason why it is important for the AGI routing script to not run on Local/ channels.

Currently, the outbound call agent routing process will immediately attempt to route the call if the Local/ channel has been resolved, and if it isn't, it will wait 1 second before trying again, then if it is still not resolved, giving up and logging the call as LRERR status. The optimization we are trying in the BETA script is to try multiple attempts at much faster intervals to check for Local/ channel resolution. The compilation of the AGI script can take anywhere from 0.1 to 0.3 seconds, depending on the server hardware and system load, then if the AGI script detects a Local/ channel, it quits and is tried again immediately. This also allows for a longer amount of time to wait for the channel to resolve because the number of loops is adjustable.

The AST_vdad_debug_log_report.php report was created to help evaluate the log entries from the BETA AGI scripts.

In our first round of live testing, we have seen the following results:
- Calls that had no resolution delay routed in 0.1 seconds on average post-Answer-signal (85% of Answered calls)
- Calls that had a resolution delay routed in 1.5 seconds on average post-Answer-signal (5% of Answered calls)
- Calls that never resolved in over 30 seconds made up less than 10% of total Answered calls
- The Asterisk 11 server had a lower rate of LRERR calls, and faster overall routing compared to 1.4 and 1.8 servers

Some conclusions based upon the first round of live testing:
- Allowing more than 1 second for channel resolution increased delayed resolution calls being routed by about 30%, although this is still only 2% of total Answered calls
- If a call does not resolve within 3 seconds post-Answer, there is very little chance it will ever resolve, although we did have a few calls resolve at 25+ seconds
- Asterisk 11 appears to be more successful at forcing resolutions, and routing calls faster, when compared to earlier branches of Asterisk







SECTION 2. DATABASE LOAD AND QUERY SPEED

Basic my.cnf and proper hardware optimizations.

Faster DB = Faster call routing

Use LSI Logic MegaRAID controllers in RAID-10 configuration with fast SSD drives with database data on separate partition from the OS and applications.





SECTION 3. AGI SCRIPT COMPILATION AND EXECUTION TIME

This section goes over the option of stripping down the AGI routing process(agi-VDAD_ALL_outbound.agi) as much as possible to improve the speed of routing outbound auto-dialed calls.

The following features could safely be removed and still allow for basic outbound call routing functions within the AGI:
	"LO" agent search method(try to route to agent on dialed server first, not used in default configs)
	CPD AMD, Sangoma call progress, answering machine detection
	QueueMetrics logging
	concurrent transfers if set to AUTO
	extension append CIDname
	grade random next-agent-call routing
	reminder message, play only
	remote-agent call routing
	routing initiated recordings
	survey recording
	survey, play message and wait for dtmf response
	text-to-speech survey
	inactive trigger process

Removing these features will result in the removal of over 65% of the code in the AGI script. This should greatly improve both perl interpretation time and reduce RAM usage, but might not have a very significant effect on execution time due to all of these removed code segments being enclosed inside of "if" statements that aren't run unless those features are activated anyway.

Testing this change will require either NOT removing the "remote-agent call routing", or testing on a production system that does not use remote-agents.


Possible outbound AGI optimizations(sections to consider removing):

750	988		text-to-speech
1026	1097		QueueMetrics logging
1101	1176		reminder message, play only
